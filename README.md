# Car_Pricing
What drives the price of a car?

### Business Understanding

In this assignment, the goal is to utilize a large data set of used car sales to create an optimized regression model that can both predict the correct price for used cars and determine which factors are most important in determining that price. The dealers can use this information to purchase cars that will hopefully have the highest resale values.
